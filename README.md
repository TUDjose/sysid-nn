# System Identification Assignment: Neural Networks

This assigment is part of the System Identification of Aerospace Vehicles course (AE4320). All code and the report was written by Jos√© 
Cunha (student n. 5216087). 

The assignment is split into three parts:
1. Implement a Kalman filter to estimate the state of a nonlinear system, and implement an ordinary least squares estimator for a simple 
   polynomial model structure
2. Create a radial basis function to approximate the model of a nonlinear system
3. Implement a feed-forward neural network to approximate the model of a nonlinear system

## Code breakdown
Here, the different code files which make up the assignment are described, refer to each for documentation of their functionality and 
implementation: 
- `read_data.py`: contains necessary functions to read the `.csv` files containing the F16 training and special validation data
- `main1.ipynb`: contains all the necessary functions to run and plot the Kalman filter, as well as for the least squares parameter 
  estimation
- `kalman.py`: documents the implementation of the Iterative Extended Kalman Filter, reconstruct the output data and visualize it
- `least_squares.py`: documents the implementation of the OLS parameter estimation, validate results and visualize them
- `main2.ipynb`: contains all the necessary functions to run, analyze and plot the radial basis function neural network
- `rbf.py`: documents the implementation of the linear regression approach to RBF networks, analysis and plotting of results
- `rbf_lm.py`: documents the implementation of RBF networks trained with the Levenberg-Marquardt learning algorithm, analysis and 
  plotting of the results
- `main3.ipynb`: contains all the necessary functions to run analyze and plot the feed-forward neural network
- `fnn.py`: documents the implementation of the FNN trained with both a backpropagation/gradient-descent algorithm and the 
  Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, analysis and plotting of the results
- `data/`: this directory contains the F16 data and the output data from the Kalman filter, as well as some pre-run examples of the code 
  to aid in the speed of the analysis plotting code (checking the influence of some neural network hyperparameter can take many minutes)
- `plots/`: this directory contains all the plots generated by the code

## Running the code
