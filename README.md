# System Identification Assignment: Neural Networks

This assigment is part of the System Identification of Aerospace Vehicles course (AE4320). All code and the report was written by Jos√© 
Cunha (student n. 5216087). 

The assignment is split into three parts:
1. Implement a Kalman filter to estimate the state of a nonlinear system, and implement an ordinary least squares estimator for a simple 
   polynomial model structure
2. Create a radial basis function to approximate the model of a nonlinear system
3. Implement a feed-forward neural network to approximate the model of a nonlinear system

The code for these three components can be seen in `main1.ipynb`, `main2.ipynb` and `main3.ipynb` respectively.
